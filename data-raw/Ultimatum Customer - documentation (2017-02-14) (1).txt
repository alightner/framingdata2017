Ultimatum Customer: Documentation

Ultimatum game with two treatments: direct response and strategy method.
In the former, one player makes an offer and the other either accepts or rejects.
It comes in two flavors, with and without hypothetical questions about the second player's response to offers other than the one that is made.
In the latter treatment, the second player is given a list of all possible offers, and is asked which ones to accept or reject.

            If this subsession is repeated (i.e. has multiple rounds), this
            field stores the position (index) of this subsession, among subsessions
            in the same app.
            For example, if a session consists of the subsessions:
            [app1, app2, app1, app1, app3]
            Then the round numbers of these subsessions would be:
            [1, 1, 2, 3, 1]
